In every game, you are the white pawn, while the opponent is the black pawn.

In single-player, the opponent (AI) plays first. In the next game, the winner rolls first.

### Local Multiplayer

Both players must be on the same WiFi network. The game uses your Local IP address. No other information is collected apart from your name. In Local multiplayer, the server (player who creates a local server) plays first. There is no option to play again in multiplayer. Players will have to create and join the server again.

## System Requirements

This game was built using Visual Studio C++, so it requires the Visual C++ redistributable package, which comes with the IDE, in order to run. If you have the IDE, then it's okay; otherwise, you will have to download the package.

## Troubleshooting
